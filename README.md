# Sunsetting Midnight Mars
This theme has been broken for quite some time and I honestly don't see myself fixing it ever. As of April 10th, 2022, development on Midnight Mars will cease. If anyone is interested in maintaing this theme themselves, feel free to.

I no longer enjoy what this theme once was, and quite honestly it was rushed and not that good. I don't plan on ever reworking this specific theme because there's so much I just do not enjoy with it.

If you're interested in something similar to Midnight Mars with a deep purple color palette, I am making another theme so make sure you keep an eye on [Midnight Essence](https://github.com/discord-extensions/midnight-essence/). It'll be ready sometime in the future (you can also check out the dev branch for something that is insanely broken if you wanna check it out now and give feedback).

Thank you to everyone who used this theme. I appreciate your support. I'm sorry if I let anyone down with this notice.
